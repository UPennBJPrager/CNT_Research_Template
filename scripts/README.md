This folder is meant to contain user scripts. At present we provide locations for python and matlab development.

We also provide a bash command meant to help set environment variables that can be used to automatically download data and create pipelines more efficiently. For more information, please consult [iEEG Workflow Example](../examples/pipeline/ieeg/iEEG_example.ipynb).

We also provide a sample directory in the python folder meant to help a user create their own whl files for code deployment across systems and environments.
