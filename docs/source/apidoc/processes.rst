Processes
==========

Processes describe how a (or several) neural networks (trainables) are trained with given data. In a large number of
cases, simply leveraging :any:`StandardClassification` will be sufficient for many cases, as it provides many
idiosynchratic options, as listed below.

See the :doc:`processes guide <../guides/processes>`  for an overview on how these work.
