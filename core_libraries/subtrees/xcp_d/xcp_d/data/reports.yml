    caption:  FD and DVARS are two measures of in-scanner motion.
              This plot shows standardized FD, DVARS, and then a carpet plot for the
              time series of each voxel/vertex's time series of activity.
    subtitle: Carpet Plot Before Postprocessing
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: censoring, suffix: motion}
    caption:  Framewise displacement (FD) is used to flag high-motion volumes,
              which are then censored as part of the denoising procedure.
              If motion filtering is requested, then the six translation and rotation motion
              parameters are filtered to remove respiratory effects before FD is calculated
              and outlier volumes are identified.

    caption:  The "design matrix" represents the confounds that are used to denoise the BOLD data.
