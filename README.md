CNT Research Repository Template
================
![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2.1-blue)

The purpose of this template is to consolidate shared libraries and enable consistent workflows and tests for most projects in the CNT lab. Users will be able to quickly load code from tested common libraries, or load their own personal code, in an object oriented manner.

# Prerequisites
In order to use this repository, you must have access to either Python or Matlab. 

We also highly recommend the use of a virtual environment, conda environment, or similar software to manage distributions. Examples for their use can be found in the documentation.

# Installation

In order to install any of the common library code, we provide instructions for both Python and Matlab below.

## Python
For python packages, python wheels and tarballs can be found in: CNT_Development/core_libraries/python/.

To install, run:

> pip install foo.whl

**or**

> pip install foo.tar.gz

where foo is the name of the library of interest.

## Matlab

:woman_shrugging: In development.

# Documentation
This template is intended to be used as both an environment and a simple wrapper for research code. Before beginning, we highly recommend that a virtual environment (or equivalent) is created for each 
project to ensure your dependencies and code are properly referenced. Examples for creating virtual environments is provided below.

## Repository Structure

A hyperlink enabled repository tree is available within the [repository_structure](./repository_structure.md) markdown file. We demonstrate the use of git-ginored files and folders by displaying those 
entries with a :warning: symbol.

A short description of some of the top-level directories and files are as follows:

### core_libraries
This folder contains the submodules and build files that make up the core libraries used for lab-wide projects.

### data_pointers
This folder contains pointers to data contained on Borel and Lief. Data requests should reference these data pointers to prevent duplication before downloading new data.

### documents
This folder contains various research documents associated with a project (i.e. SoPs, Pipeline diagrams, etc.) as well as code documentation (e.g.document strings) for the various libraries.

### examples
This folder contains example python and matlab scripts for various research tasks as well as how to use common libraries and environments.

### reference_data
This folder contains data that can be used for building targets or conducting unit tests.

### sample_data
This folder contains sample data that might be used in any of the lab-wide projects.

### scripts
This folder contains user-defined scripts. 

### unit_tests
This folder contains unit tests for validating new/altered code at both the machine level and model level.

### user_data
This folder is meant to store user data. Data in this repository is private by default and will not be uploaded to public repositories.

### .gitignore

This file helps prevent certain files from being uploaded to the public repository. This can be to avoid excess data volumes, or to protect sensitive information. By default, the ignored files and 
folders are designed for the development of a lab-wide template, and users should adjust the settings to match their own needs.

# Virtual Environments

## Python

### Conda

We recommend using the pre-built environment files provided to start your project. These files can be found in the following subfolders: core_libraries/python/*/*yml and can be installed using the following command:
> conda env create -f foo.yml

where foo is the name of the environment.

For those who wish to create their own environment, we introduced some of the basics below.

#### Creation
> conda create --name myenv

where myenv is the name of the environment you wish to create.

#### Listing environments
> conda env list

#### Activating Environment
> conda activate myenv

where myenv is the name of the environment you wish to activate.

#### Deactivating an environment
> conda deactivate

#### More information
For more information, please read: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment

### Virtual Environment

First make sure you have venv installed. If not, you can pip install it as follows: pip install venv

#### Creation
> python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

#### Listing environments
> lsvirtualenv

You may need to install virutalenvwrapper to use this command. ( pip install virtualenvwrapper. ) If it doesn't populate to your path, check the package directory for the executable.

#### Activating Environment
> source /path/to/venv/bin/activate

#### Deactivating an environment
> deactivate

(Type this command in your shell.)
