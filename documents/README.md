This folder is meant to store important information for each projects management. This includes things such as the SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) and the pipeline. Future iterations may also include supplementary or in-development research papers, if requested.

We also include code documentation within this folder. At present code documentation is created by returning any document strings found for the various functions found within our core code libraries.
